I researched on the internet and some answers includes enabling the "access for lesser app" and "unlocking gmail 
captcha" which sadly didn't work for me until I found the 2-step verification.

What I did the following was:

enable the 2-step verification to google [!HERE](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/)

Create App Password to be use by your system [!HERE](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords)

I selected Others (custom name) and clicked generate

Went to my env file in laravel and edited this

MAIL_USERNAME=talentscoutphil@gmail.com

MAIL_PASSWORD=thepasswordgenerated

Restarted my apache server and boom! It works again. This was my solution. I created this to at least make 
other people not go wasting their time researching for a possible answer.
